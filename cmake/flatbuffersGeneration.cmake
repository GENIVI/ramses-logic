# This CMake file creates a target FlatbufGen which re-generates flatbuffers
# header files from schemas and puts results back in the source tree
#
# Works like this:
# Case #1: with code generation (default)
# cmake <src>       # Creates FlatbufGen and FlatbufCheck targets based on *.fbs files
# make              # generates *_gen.h files from *.fbs files and overwrites source tree.
#                   # If a new *.fbs file was added, has to re-run cmake (as with any other src files)
#                   # If existing *.fbs file changes, regenerates ALL *_gen.h files and rebuilds anything that depends on them
#                   # If no change in *.fbs files, does nothing
#
# Case #2: no code generation (explicitly disabled)
# cmake -Dramses-logic_ENABLE_FLATBUFFERS_GENERATION=OFF <src>
# make              # Uses checked-in *_gen.h files and ignores any changes in *.fbs files
# make FlatbufGen   # Fails - no such targets because disabled

file(GLOB flatbuffers_schemas "${PROJECT_SOURCE_DIR}/lib/flatbuffers/schemas/*.fbs")
set(flatbuffers_output_dir "${PROJECT_SOURCE_DIR}/lib/flatbuffers/generated")

# create list of *_gen.h out of *.fbs file list

# TODO Violin/Tobias investigate the "--conform" option of flatc - looks very promising
# as a solution for backwards compatibility which can be automatically checked!

# Additional interesting options to investigate in the future:
# --reflect-types/--reflect-names  - maybe for type backwards compatibility
# --root-type - maybe not specify the root type in schemas, but from outside
# --force-empty-vectors - avoid nullptr
# --flexbuffers - schemaless buffers

# Custom command which:
# - deletes all generated headers in source TARGET_FILE
# - regenerates headers from current *.fbs files in source tree
