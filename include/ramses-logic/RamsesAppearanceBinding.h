     * The RamsesAppearanceBinding is a type of #rlogic::RamsesBinding which allows the #rlogic::LogicEngine to control instances
     * of ramses::Appearance. RamsesAppearanceBinding's can be created with #rlogic::LogicEngine::createRamsesAppearanceBinding.
     *
     * The #RamsesAppearanceBinding has a static link to a ramses::Appearance. After creation, #rlogic::LogicNode::getInputs will
     * return a struct property with children equivalent to the uniform inputs of the provided ramses Appearance.
     *
     * Since the RamsesAppearanceBinding derives from #rlogic::RamsesBinding, it also provides the #rlogic::LogicNode::getInputs
     * and #rlogic::LogicNode::getOutputs method. For this particular implementation, the methods behave as follows:
     *  - #rlogic::LogicNode::getInputs: returns an empty struct with no child properties if no ramses::Appearance is currently assigned
     *  - #rlogic::LogicNode::getInputs: returns the inputs corresponding to the available shader uniforms of ramses::Appearance if such is assigned
     *  - #rlogic::LogicNode::getOutputs: returns always nullptr, because a #RamsesAppearanceBinding does not have outputs,
     *    it implicitly controls the ramses Appearance
     *
     * All shader uniforms are supported, except the following:
     * - texture samplers of any kind
     * - matrix types (e.g. mat4, mat23 etc.)
     * - any uniform with attached semantics (e.g. display resolution) - see ramses::EEffectUniformSemantic docs
     *
     * Uniform types which are not supported are not available when queried over #rlogic::LogicNode::getInputs.
