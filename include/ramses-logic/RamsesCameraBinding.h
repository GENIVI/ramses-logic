     * The RamsesCameraBinding is a type of #rlogic::RamsesBinding which allows the #rlogic::LogicEngine to control instances
     * of ramses::Camera. RamsesCameraBinding's can be created with #rlogic::LogicEngine::createRamsesCameraBinding.
     *
     * The #RamsesCameraBinding has a static link to a ramses::Camera. After creation, #rlogic::LogicNode::getInputs will
     * return a struct property with children equivalent to the camera settings of the provided ramses camera.
     *
     * There are two types of ramses::Camera:
     *  - ramses::PerspectiveCamera
     *  - ramses::OrthographicCamera.
     * Both camera types are defined through their viewport and their frustum properties. These are represented as two separate property structs
     * in the RamsesCameraBinding. Be aware if you set one or more values to one of the structs on the binding and update the LogicEngine it will lead
     * to all properties of this struct being set on the actual ramses::Camera.
     * For example if you only set the ViewportOffsetX of the Camera per linked script or directly on the binding it will set
     * ViewportOffsetX, ViewportOffsetY, ViewportWidth and ViewportHeight to whatever the state of the properties is at that moment.
     * So if you haven't set the other three properties on the binding before, the ramses::Camera will be updated to the default values
     * for those. The frustum values of the ramses::Camera are not affected when setting viewport values, and vice-versa. Check the ramses::Camera API to see which values belong together.
     * To avoid unexpected behavior, we highly recommend setting all viewport values together, and also setting all frustum planes together (either by link or by setting them directly).
     * This way unwanted behaviour can be avoided.
     *
     * Since the RamsesCameraBinding derives from #rlogic::RamsesBinding, it also provides the #rlogic::LogicNode::getInputs
     * and #rlogic::LogicNode::getOutputs method. For this particular implementation, the methods behave as follows:
     *  - #rlogic::LogicNode::getInputs: returns an empty struct with no child properties if no ramses::Camera is currently assigned
     *  - #rlogic::LogicNode::getInputs: returns inputs struct with two child properties: viewPortProperties and frustumProperties.
     *                                   Their child properties in turn vary for the two available camera types (ramses::PerspectiveCamera and ramses::OrthographicCamera)
     *      - Perspective Camera:  viewPortProperties --> viewPortOffsetX, viewPortOffsetY, viewPortWidth, viewPortHeight
     *                             frustumProperties  --> fieldOfView, aspectRatio, nearPlane, farPlane
     *      - Orthographic Camera: viewPortProperties --> same as for Perspective Camera
     *                             frustumProperties  --> leftPlane, rightPlane, bottomPlane, topPlane, nearPlane, farPlane
     *  - #rlogic::LogicNode::getOutputs: returns always nullptr, because a #RamsesCameraBinding does not have outputs,
     *    it implicitly controls the ramses Camera
