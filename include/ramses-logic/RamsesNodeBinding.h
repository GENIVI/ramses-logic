     * The RamsesNodeBinding is a type of #rlogic::RamsesBinding which allows manipulation of Ramses nodes.
     * RamsesNodeBinding's can be created with #rlogic::LogicEngine::createRamsesNodeBinding.
     *
     * The RamsesNodeBinding has a fixed set of inputs which correspond to properties of ramses::Node.
     * They have a fixed type, name, and initial value:
     * \rst
     * 'visibility' (type bool) [initialized to: true]
     * 'rotation' (type vec3f) [initialized to: (0, 0, 0)]
     * 'translation' (type vec3f) [initialized to: (0, 0, 0)]
     * 'scaling' (type vec3f) [initialized to: (1, 1, 1)]

    .. warning::

        The 'rotation' property is using the right-handed XYZ Euler convention, which corresponds to the
        ramses::ERotationConvention::XYZ enum. It is imperative to use the same convention when setting/
        getting the rotation values of the bound ramses::Node to avoid unexpected transformation issues.
        We will try to make this more explicit and error-proof in future releases!

     \endrst
     *
     * The RamsesNodeBinding class has no output properties (thus getOutputs() will return nullptr) because
     * the outputs are implicitly the properties of the bound Ramses node.
     *
     * The RamsesNodeBinding is updated every time when rlogic::LogicEngine::update() is executed. The
     * RamsesNodeBinding propagates the values of its inputs to the Ramses node properties accordingly.
     *
    * \rst
    .. note::

        In case no values were set (because the user neither set a value explicitly
        nor linked the input of rlogic::RamsesNodeBinding to another LogicNode output) the Ramses values
        are not touched. It is possible to set values directly to ramses::Node which will not be overwritten
        by rlogic::RamsesNodeBinding if you never explicitly assigned a value to the rlogic::RamsesNodeBinding inputs.
        You can also mix-and-match this behavior - assign some properties and others not.

     \endrst
     *
     *
     * The LogicEngine does not restrict which Scene the bound nodes belong to - it is possible to have
     * nodes from different scenes bound to the same LogicEngine, and vice-versa. The effects
     * on the ramses::Node property values which are bound to a rlogic::RamsesNodeBinding are immediately
     * visible after rlogic::LogicEngine::update() returns, however the user has to call ramses::Scene::flush()
     * explicitly based on their scene update logic and frame lifecycle.
